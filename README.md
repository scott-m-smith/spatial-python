### Welcome
This repository contains code and notes for spatial data management and analysis using [Python](https://www.python.org).

### Purpose
Primarily to serve as a central location to store code, methods, and information for using Python as a tool to manage and analyze geospatial data.

**For those visiting**
* Feel free to use anything you see useful with the disclaimer that code should be considered beta/test/experimental/use at your own risk.
* I have tried to include source references for any code I have incorporated into my examples.
* Links are provided to packages used in each example.
